# Physical Media
Though a large portion of this repository is dedicated to documenting our coding process, equally important to the project are the physical mediums it manifested through. There are two broad categories for the physical apsects of this project: the wiring and Arduino hardware, and the set design of the diorama. Here, we will mostly be discussing the development of these aspects separately, as they didn't come together until towards the end of the project. If you want to see everything working together in action, check out our video included in this repository.

## Arduino Build
I (Emme) took the lead on the Arduino coding and wiring portion of this project. Because of the iterative nature of revising code (the details of which can be found in [this file](codeHistory.md)), the hardware and our wiring evolved over the course of the project. 

From our brainstorming, we knew that we would want to use servo motors to open and close the doors of a wardrobe and have an LED for the iconic Narnia lamppost. Wiring an LED light seemed more straightforward, so we started with getting the servo motors working. The first tutorial we followed for coding and wiring was to use a button to move a servo motor, and since we knew that we would have double doors on the wardrobe, we quickly added a second servo motor (Fig. 1).

*Fig 1. Our first iteration of wiring, which included two servo motors and one button to move them. This was a good start, but the wiring was too messy to be sustainable, especially as we continued to add elements, so we ended up completely redoing this same setup to look nicer.*
