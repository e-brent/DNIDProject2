# Physical Media
Though a large portion of this repository is dedicated to documenting our coding process, equally important to the project are the physical mediums it manifested through. There are two broad categories for the physical apsects of this project: the wiring and Arduino hardware, and the set design of the diorama. Here, we will mostly be discussing the development of these aspects separately, as they didn't come together until towards the end of the project. If you want to see everything working together in action, check out our video included in this repository.
