# DNID Project 2
This project was completed in spring 2023 for unit 2 of ENGLIT 1201 Digital Narrative and Interactive Design. The purpose of the project was to use Arduino and physical media to represent a scene from a children's book. This repository was created to document our process of creating this assignment. 

## Files 
|Directory/file name|Description|

|Images|This directory contains images and some short videos we took throughout our project. If relevant, they have been included in other files in this repository and given context, as well as alt text description.|
The code was written separately and not committed throughout the process, but during the project we kept a backup file with changes made to the code, in case we needed to go back to a previous version, so I will be cleanign and commenting that file and adding it here to show our process and the major hurdles for that portion of the project. For the wiring of our Arduino Uno and the process of creating our diorama, we took pictures throughout the process that we will upload here and to tell the story of our project development. 

We will also be creating a video describing our final project and demonstrating it in action.

For our children's book, we decided to do *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe* by C.S. Lewis. published in 1950. The book we were speicfically using for reference was the read aloud edition published by HarperCollins in 2005. Both of us have very fond memories of reading this book as a child and experiencing the excited feeling when Lucy goes to Narnia for the first time, then feeling her frustration as she tried to show her siblings and was dismissed. We wanted to recreate this experience of both the magic of Narnia and the uncertainty of whether you will be able to see it again.
